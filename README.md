Logistic Regression Project

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression is a fundamental statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, frequently applied in fields like marketing, healthcare, and finance.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Applied feature scaling and data cleaning for improved model accuracy.
Model Training and Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Requirements
Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, Pandas.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Run C1_W3_Logistic_Regression.ipynb to train and test the model.
